# ld3z's Createpak

Documentation will go here.

Eventually, this will all be moved to a separate site but currently, I am too lazy for that.

Unfortunately, some issues with packwiz make this project completely unbearable, to the point that if there were a better tool, I would be using it.

But, given the caveats of this tool, I'm using for the sake of easy server setup.

You can find the latest download to the pack [here](https://github.com/ld3z/createpak/releases/latest). Please download the correct .zip if you're using CurseForge or the .mrpack if you're using Modrinth.

> [!WARNING]  
> Note that the modpack may be missing mods on Third-Party launchers and you may need to seek out what is missing!
